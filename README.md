# Time-Series-Forecasting-and-Sunspot-Prediction
# Abstract
This repository summarizes the work done by Manideep Pendyala during an internship under the guidance of Dr. Saurabh Das at IIT Indore from March to June 2022. The project focuses on time series forecasting, with a particular emphasis on predicting sunspot activity.
# Data Exploration
The project uses historical sunspot data collected from Kaggle, covering monthly mean total sunspot numbers from 1749 to 2021. The dataset was processed, and exploratory data analysis was performed to understand the characteristics of the data.
# Model Training
Several models were trained and evaluated for sunspot prediction: Autoregression (AR)
Moving Average (MA)
Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA)
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
Linear Regression
Random Forest
XGBoost. 
Random Forest and XGBoost emerged as the best-performing models for this task.
