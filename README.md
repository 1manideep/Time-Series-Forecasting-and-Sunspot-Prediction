# Time-Series-Forecasting-and-Sunspot-Prediction
# Abstract
This repository summarizes the work done by Manideep Pendyala during an internship under the guidance of Dr. Saurabh Das at IIT Indore from March to June 2022. The project focuses on time series forecasting, with a particular emphasis on predicting sunspot activity.
# Data Exploration
The project uses historical sunspot data collected from Kaggle, covering monthly mean total sunspot numbers from 1749 to 2021. The dataset was processed, and exploratory data analysis was performed to understand the characteristics of the data.
# Model Training
Several models were trained and evaluated for sunspot prediction: Autoregression (AR)
Moving Average (MA)
Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA)
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
Linear Regression
Random Forest
XGBoost. 
# Evaluation Criteria
The models were evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric, with Random Forest producing the lowest RMSE, followed by XGBoost and ARIMA(6,1,2).

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of various time series forecasting models to predict sunspot activity. Random Forest and XGBoost models showed promising results for accurate predictions.
